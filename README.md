# YouTubeDownloader
app.py is the app where you can download youtube videos. The YouTubeDownloader.py is the "back-end," where you can edit it 
to your liking. Enjoy!


**Steps**
- Download the files (either through vs-code, or zip)
- If you downloaded as zip, unzip them
- Install python using the microsoft store
- right click to edit the YouTubeDownloader.py to your liking (*THE FILEPATH IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO CUSTOMIZE, WITHOUT IT, YOU WILL MOST LIKELY GET ERRORS*)
- double click the app.py file
- Download as many YouTube videos to your hearts content :D

**TroubleShooting**
- if you get an error about pytube, open cmd and type "pip install pytube" if you are on mac, and that didn't work, try "pip3 install pytube".

This is 100% safe, run it through any antivirus software you want; I also commented a lot so you can understand step-by-step what lines of code do what.
